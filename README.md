# Apple Detection with YOLOv8

This project implements an apple detection system using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. The model has been trained on a custom dataset created using **Roboflow** to detect apples in images.

## Project Overview

The system uses YOLOv8 to detect apples in real-time images or videos. The model was trained using images labeled via **Roboflow**. Once the model was trained, it was tested and deployed in **Visual Studio Code** using Python and OpenCV for image and video processing.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- YOLOv8 model and dependencies
- OpenCV for image processing
- **Roboflow** API for accessing the dataset

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/esinakfidan/-apple-detection-yolov8.git
# -apple-detection-yolov8
